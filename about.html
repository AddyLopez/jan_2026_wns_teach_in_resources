          <h2>ABOUT WORKERS FOR A NEW SOUTHWEST (WNS)</h2>
          <p>
            &quot;WNS exists to build a fighting socialist movement in New
            Mexico. We take New Mexico's real conditions&mdash;scarce water,
            rising rents, land loss, and a war and extraction economy&mdash;and
            treat them as the ground for new working class institutions. We aim
            to link labor fights, tenant work, and community defense into one
            front. We reject the idea that workers need either duopoly party,
            nonprofits, or wealthy patrons to act. We push people to move as a
            class with their own institutions, strategy, and discipline.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;The Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice strives to create
            a world where our collective needs are met sustainably and
            nonviolently.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;We value the interconnectedness of all life. We emphasize
            cooperation and respect for diversity. We are committed to
            nonviolent conflict resolution, working for peace within ourselves,
            our community, and our world.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;We provide space for organizations and individuals working on
            peace and justice issues to network with one another, share
            information, and learn from each others' work. Through our programs
            and collaborations, we work locally to support regional and global
            justice.&quot;
